            <h3>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h3>
            <p>
                They come from every state to find<br>
                Some dreams were meant to be declined<br>
                Tell the man what did you have in mind<br>
                What have you come to do?<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                No turning water into wine<br>
                No learning while you're in the line<br>
                I'll take you to the broken sign<br>
                You see these lights are blue<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Come and get it<br>
                Lost it at the city limit<br>
                Say goodbye<br>
                'Cause they will find a way to trim it<br>
                Everybody<br>
                Lookin' for a silly gimmick<br>
                Gotta get away<br>
                Can't take it for another minute<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                This town is made of many things<br>
                Just look at what the current brings<br>
                So high, it's only promising<br>
                This place was made on you<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tell me, baby, what's your story<br>
                Where you come from<br>
                And where you wanna go this time?<br>
                Tell me, lover, are you lonely?<br>
                The thing we need is<br>
                Never all that hard to find<br>
                Tell me, baby, what's your story<br>
                Where do you come from<br>
                And where you wanna go this time?<br>
                You're so lovely, are you lonely?<br>
                Giving up on the innocence you left behind<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Some claim to have the fortitude<br>
                Too shrewd to blow the interlude<br>
                Sustaining pain to set a mood<br>
                Step out to be renewed<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll move you like a baritone<br>
                Jungle brothers on the microphone<br>
                Getting over with an undertone<br>
                It's time to turn to stone<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Chitty chitty, baby<br>
                When your nose is in the nitty gritty<br>
                Life could be a little sweet<br>
                But life could be a little shitty<br>
                What a pity<br>
                Boston and a Kansas city<br>
                Looking for a hundred<br>
                But you only ever found a fitty<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Three fingers in the honeycomb<br>
                You ring just like a xylophone<br>
                Devoted to the chromosome<br>
                The day that you left home<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tell me, baby, what's your story<br>

            <p>
                A lazy rain am I ,<br>
                The skies refuse to cry<br>
                Cremation takes its piece of your supply<br>
                The night is dressed like noon<br>
                A sailor spoke too soon<br>
                And China's on the dark side of the moon<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Platypus are a few<br>
                The secret life of roo<br>
                A personality I never knew (get it on)<br>
                My Greta weighs a ton<br>
                The archers on the run<br>
                And no one stands alone behind the sun<br>

                It's been a long time since I made a new friend<br>
                Waitin' on another black summer to end<br>
                It's been a long time and you never know when<br>
                Waitin' on another black summer to end<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Crack the flaming whip<br>
                A-sailing on a censorship<br>
                Riding on a headless horse to make the trip<br>
